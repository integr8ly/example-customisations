[id='amq-to-rest-api_{context}']
= Implement an AMQ to REST API sample integration


:context: amq2api
The sample integration connects to an AMQ broker to obtain item
delivery records for a hypothetical enterprise. The integration then executes
a custom step that operates on the records to identify any
items that were damaged when they were received. After a simple data mapping,
the integration connects to
a REST API to obtain and provide contact information for vendors of
damaged items.

The other sample integrations use connectors and data operations that are built
into {prodname}. This integration also does that, but in addition,
it provides instructions for customizing
and extending {prodname} by leading you through the procedures for:

* Adding a custom data operation by uploading an extension.
* Adding a custom REST API client connector by uploading an OpenAPI (Swagger) file.

{prodname} provides the extension file and the OpenAPI file.

[id='amq2api-create-amq-connection_{context}']
= Create an AMQ connection

The AMQ to REST API sample integration starts by connecting to an
AMQ broker that is provided in your OpenShift Online  project. Before you
start to create the integration itself, you must start the broker
and create an AMQ connection to that broker.

.Procedure

. Start the broker:

.. In a browser, go to the
link:{openshift-host
}[OpenShift Online Web Console].
Your {prodname} environment runs on OpenShift Online.

.. In the console, on the right, under *My Projects*, click *Fuse Online* to
display the project's overview.
+
Your project's name is something like `proj123456`.

.. In the overview, click the first entry, *broker-amq, #1* to expand the entry for the
provided AMQ broker.

.. On the right, click the up caret to scale up to running 1 pod. This starts
the AMQ broker.

. Create the AMQ connection:

.. In {prodname}, in the left panel, click *Connections* to display any
available connections.
.. In the upper right, click *Create Connection* to display
{prodname} connectors.
.. Click the *AMQ* connector.
.. Configure the connection by entering:
+
... In the *Broker URL* field, enter `*tcp://broker-amq-tcp:61616*`
as the location to obtain data from.
... In the *Username* field, enter `*amq*` as the user name for
the account that accesses this AMQ broker.
... In the *Password* field, enter `*topSecret*` as the password for
the account that accesses this AMQ broker.
... Leave the other fields blank.
.. Click *Validate*. {prodname} immediately tries to validate the
connection and displays a message that indicates whether
validation is successful. If validation fails, check the values you
entered and try again.
.. When validation is successful, click *Next*.
.. In the *Connection Name* field, enter your choice of a name that
helps you distinguish this connection from any other connections.
For example, enter `*AMQ Broker 1*`.
.. In the *Description* field, optionally enter any information that
is helpful to know about this connection. For example,
enter `*Sample AMQ connection
that uses the provided broker.*`



[type=verification]
In the upper right, click *Create* to see that the connection you created is now available. If you entered the example name, you would see that *AMQ Broker 1* is now available.

[id='amq2api-create-custom-step_{context}']
= Make a custom step available

{prodname} provides a number of steps that operate on
integration data between connections. If {prodname} does not provide a
between-connections step that meets your need,
a developer can code an extension that defines one or more
custom steps that operate on data between connections.
The developer gives you a `.jar` file that contains the extension.
You then upload the extension in {prodname} to make the custom step(s)
available for use in integrations.

The AMQ to REST API sample integration uses a custom step that
operates on data between connections to
identify items that were damaged when they were received.

.Procedure

. In a new browser tab, go to
https://github.com/syndesisio/fuse-online-sample-extension/releases.

. Download the extension’s `.jar` file.

. In {prodname}, in the left panel, click *Customizations*.
. At the top, click *Extensions*.
. Click *Import Extension*.
. Click *Browse* and select the downloaded `.jar` file that contains the
extension.
{prodname} validates the file, extracts and displays the extension's
name, ID, and description, and lists *Damage Reporter* as the custom step
that the extension defines.
. Click *Import*. {prodname} makes the custom step available and displays
the extension details page.

[id='amq2api-create-rest-api-connector_{context}']
= Create a REST API connector

{prodname} can create connectors for REST APIs
that support Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)/1.0 or HTTP/1.1.
To do this, {prodname} requires a valid
OpenAPI 2.0 specification that describes a REST API you want to connect to.

Your {prodname} environment provides the To Do app, which has a REST API
for accessing a database that contains tasks. Your environment also provides
an OpenAPI (Swagger) specification for this API.

.Procedure

. Identify the URL for your {prodname} environment's copy of the
OpenAPI specification:
.. In the {prodname} navigation panel, click *Home*.
.. Copy the URL into a text editor.
.. At the beginning of the URL, insert `*todo-*`.
.. At the end of the URL, replace `dashboard` with `*swagger.json*`.
.. Use the `http` scheme instead of `https`.

+
The result is something like this:
`\http://todo-app-proj217402.6a63.fuse-ignite.openshiftapps.com/swagger.json`

. In the {prodname} navigation panel, click *Customizations*.
. Click *Create API Connector*.
. Select *Use a URL*.
. In the input box, paste the URL for your OpenAPI specification and
click *Next*.
. On the *Review OpenAPI Actions* page, click *Next*. If you see
a warning, you can ignore it.
. Click *Next* again to accept *HTTP Basic Authorization*.
. On the *Review/Edit Connector Details* page, {prodname} populates
the fields with values from the OpenAPI specification.
.. If you want to, you can
change the values in the *Connector Name* and *Description* fields.
.. Confirm that the value in the *Host* field is correct. For example,
it should be something like this:
`\http://todo-app-proj217402.6a63.fuse-ignite.openshiftapps.com`.
.. Confirm that the value in the *Base URL* field is `/api`.
. Click *Create API Connector*.
+
{prodname} displays the *API Client Connectors* tab with an entry for
the *Todo App API* that you just created.

[id='amq2api-upload-todo-app-icon_{context}']
= Upload the To Do app icon

To show the flow of an integration, {prodname} displays icons that identify
the applications that the integration is connecting to. Your {prodname}
environment provides an icon for the To Do app. Follow these instructions
to upload it.

.Procedure

. Display the To Do app icon:

.. In a new browser tab, paste the URL for your OpenAPI (Swagger) specification.
.. At the end of the URL, replace `swagger.json` with `images/todo_icon.png`
and click *Enter*. For example:
`\https://todo-app-proj217402.6a63.fuse-ignite.openshiftapps.com/images/todo_icon.png`.

. Save the `todo_icon.png` image.

. In {prodname}, in the *API Client Connectors* tab, click the entry for
the *Todo App API* to display its details.

. On the *Connector Details* page, click *Browse*.

. Navigate to `todo_icon.png`, select it, and click *Open*.

. Refresh the display of the *Connector Details* page.
The image now appears on the left.

+
A {prodname} account is limited to a specific number of
integrations that can be running at one time. For details,
see the pricing plan. If you are already running the maximum
number of integrations, then you must stop an integration
before you can start running another one.
+
If you are using a {prodname} evaluation
account, then only one integration at a time can be running.
If you already created one of the other sample integrations and that
integration is running then this integration is automatically in the
*Stopped* state. You must stop the running integration and
then you can then publish this integration.

. If you are already running the maximum number of integrations, follow
these steps to stop an integration:
